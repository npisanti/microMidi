Arduino sketch to convert capacitive sensor data to midi CC and Note messages. You need the MIDIUSB library and an Arduino that supports it, like micro or Leonardo. You can connect alligator clips to objects and sense when the objects are touched.


Here's another messy prototype (with screw terminals for connect up to 10 capacitive sensors)
