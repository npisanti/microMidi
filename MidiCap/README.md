Arduino sketch to convert capacitive sensor data to midi CC and Note messages. You need the MIDIUSB library and an Arduino that supports it, like micro or Leonardo. To wire the thing check out the CapacitiveSensor library tutorial. The values in the sketch are for a 18x18cm tin foil square with a 10MOhm resistor ( no capacitors to ground ).

Here's another messy prototype (with screw terminals for piezos)
